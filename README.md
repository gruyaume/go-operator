## Why write a Charm in Go?

Reliability is the most important attribute of a charm. DevOps teams should focus their attention on operating their services, and the Charms they use should be reliable and predictable. The official Charm framework is written in Python, which is great for getting started quickly. Contrary to popular belief, Python's biggest weakness is not its performance but its unreliability. Charms rely on the Python interpreter, which means that the environment where the charm runs can significantly differ from the environment where the charm was developed, leading to unexpected behavior. Building charms for multiple bases and architectures is a pain, mainly because of the Python interpreter.
